# ADVACRUIT
### Advocating connections & advancing careers

Founded by Zane Stotts

## Description

This website is intended to be a rough draft for my new recruiting company. After eighteen months of unsuccessful job hunting, I have become very familiar with several staffing businesses and navigating their websites. My hope is to hold a mirror up to any recruiters who visit while also displaying my expanding skills in web development.

## Languages

My project is constructed from primarily HTML, along with heavy doses of CSS. I do love my styling and feel very confident with those two languages by now. I also plan to add several JavaScript features later in the process. My Advacruit project also marks the first time I have implemented a server side language before, so I am still figuring some things out as I go.

## Design

Will add later as project continues.

## Reflections

Will add later as project continues.
